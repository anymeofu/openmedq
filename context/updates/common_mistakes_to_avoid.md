## ⚠️ Common Mistakes & Gotchas

To prevent repeating code defects and build warnings/errors, adhere to the following checklist:

### 1. TypeScript Timer Refs in Browser Contexts
* **Mistake**: Declaring `const timerRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null)` in React component files.
* **Problem**: In a web browser environment, the `NodeJS` namespace is not globally defined. This causes `tsc` compilation to fail with `Cannot find namespace 'NodeJS'`.
* **Fix**: Use `ReturnType<typeof setInterval>` or `any` or `number` to store references returned by `setInterval` or `setTimeout` in client-side React files:
  ```typescript
  const timerRef = useRef<any>(null); // or ReturnType<typeof setInterval>
  ```

### 2. Unused Variable Declarations
* **Mistake**: Retaining temporary debug variables or importing icons/types that are never referenced in the final JSX.
* **Problem**: Strict linter/compiler rules will abort production builds (`npm run build:frontend`) if unused variables exist.
* **Fix**: Always strip unused imports and declarations (e.g. `isQuestionAnswered`, unused Lucide icons like `BookOpen` if not rendered).

### 3. Duplicate Configurations
* **Mistake**: Defining local array constants (like the 19 standard MBBS subjects) inside multiple layout files.
* **Problem**: Causes code redundancy and desynchronization issues if counts or names change.
* **Fix**: Move shared configurations to a centralized location (such as [subjects.ts](file:///Users/sain/development/openmedq/frontend/src/lib/subjects.ts)) and import it everywhere.

### 4. Spawning Sequential CLI Calls for Bulk R2 Uploads
* **Mistake**: Iteratively spawning `npx wrangler r2 object put` via child processes to upload thousands of files.
* **Problem**: Spawning thousands of CLI commands causes massive Node engine startup overhead and will run extremely slowly (taking 45+ minutes) or hang in non-interactive terminal environments.
* **Fix**: Write a custom script that interacts directly with the Cloudflare REST API v4 object upload endpoint (`PUT /accounts/{account_id}/r2/buckets/{bucket_name}/objects/{key}`) using Bearer Tokens. Stagger requests (150ms delay), restrict concurrency (limit to 5), and implement exponential backoff on `HTTP 429` rate-limit responses.
### 5. Wrangler Empty String vars and Clerk Middleware Crash
* **Mistake**: Defining empty strings for `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` in the `vars` block of `wrangler.jsonc` without providing matching local secrets in `.dev.vars`.
* **Problem**: In Hono workers, `clerkMiddleware()` reads credentials from the environment context (`c.env`). If wrangler defines empty strings in `wrangler.jsonc`, it overrides local environment bindings with `""` and causes Clerk to throw `Error: Clerk: Missing Secret Key` on worker startup.
* **Fix**: Ensure that `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` are defined in `.dev.vars` during local development to override the empty string placeholders.

### 6. Mismatched MCQ Option Indexing (0-indexed vs 1-indexed)
* **Mistake**: Direct mapping of the raw MedMCQA `cop` (correct option) field without converting it to 1-indexed values.
* **Problem**: In the HF MedMCQA dataset, `cop` values are `0, 1, 2, 3` (representing options A, B, C, D respectively). However, the frontend maps options using keys `1, 2, 3, 4`. Directly using `cop` values causes validation to fail (e.g. correct option A is checked as key `0` and never matches choice key `1`).
* **Fix**: Map `correctOption` in the backend API to convert `0, 1, 2, 3` values to `1, 2, 3, 4` dynamically before serving, and clear the client's local IndexedDB question cache via a one-time migration to discard any old 0-indexed values.

### 7. Online Custom QBank Questions Caching
* **Mistake**: Fetching custom test questions dynamically from a remote API/R2 bucket online but failing to cache them in the local `db.questions` IndexedDB table.
* **Problem**: The dashboard aggregations compute subject completion and correctness by looping over local questions from `db.questions`. If questions solved in online tests are not cached locally, the progress rows in `db.progress` cannot map back to their subjects, causing the dashboard to show 0% progress despite users practicing.
* **Fix**: Always save online-fetched custom practice questions in `db.questions` using `db.questions.put(q)` (or a bulk transaction) inside the initializer in `PracticeSuite.tsx`.

### 8. Missing useEffect Dependencies in Auth/Sync Hooks
* **Mistake**: Leaving dynamic callback parameters like `getToken` out of a `useEffect` dependency array when starting background sync or P2P signaling loops.
* **Problem**: The effect runs using a stale token reference or misses updates when the token rotates, leading to signaling/sync authentication failures.
* **Fix**: Always include all external callbacks, references, and state variables in the hook's dependency array (e.g., `getToken` in `App.tsx`'s P2P hook).

### 9. Infinite Recursion in Rate Limited Upload Retries
* **Mistake**: Scheduling another retry unconditionally inside a 429 response block of a script.
* **Problem**: If the rate limit persists, the script will recurse forever, leading to resource leaks or crash due to stack overflow.
* **Fix**: Ensure that the 429 handler checks the current attempt count against `MAX_RETRIES` and exits/rejects when exceeded.

### 10. Non-Transactional Clear + Bulk Add Database Operations
* **Mistake**: Calling `db.reviewLogs.clear()` followed by `db.reviewLogs.bulkAdd()` sequentially without wrapping them in a transaction.
* **Problem**: If `bulkAdd` fails halfway, the table is left empty, causing total data loss.
* **Fix**: Wrap atomic sync operations in a Dexie transaction block: `await db.transaction('rw', db.reviewLogs, async () => { await db.reviewLogs.clear(); await db.reviewLogs.bulkAdd(logsToPut); })`.

### 11. Unvalidated FSRS Array Parameters and Interval Modifier Math
* **Mistake**: Unconditionally accessing `w[20]` or assuming the weights array size is at least 21 without verification, and calculating `Math.pow` or `Math.log` without guarding.
* **Problem**: Can yield `undefined` or `NaN` inside the interval modifier equation, leading to corrupt spaced repetition scheduling.
* **Fix**: Validate the weights array size and check that target weights are finite numbers, and guard calculations with `Number.isFinite` constraints.

### 12. Strict LWW on Cumulative Dopa Metrics in Local-First Sync
* **Mistake**: Merging local-first monthly Dopa and lifetime XP using strict `updatedAt` Last-Write-Wins (LWW) rules.
* **Problem**: If the user opens an old device, the startup daily streak check will update the local `updatedAt` to the current time, making it look newer than the remote synced state even though its Dopa/XP value is lower. On sync merge, the newer timestamp will cause the old device's lower Dopa to win, downgrading the user's level and progress.
* **Fix**: Since Dopa and XP are cumulative metrics that only increase under normal operation, merge them by taking the maximum Dopa and the maximum `updatedAt` timestamp (`Math.max` on both). Double-guard the D1 database using SQLite's `MAX(excluded.dopa, user_monthly_dopa.dopa)` on conflict updates.

### 13. Nested Button Elements in Option Cards
* **Mistake**: Wrapping a text button (e.g. `<button>` for option selections) inside a card container alongside an image, while keeping the outer card container as a non-clickable `div`.
* **Problem**: Clicking on the image or the card's padding does not trigger the button's `onClick` handler, making portions of the card unresponsive. Conversely, nesting `<button>` inside `<button>` is invalid HTML and causes event bubbling and click propagation bugs.
* **Fix**: Convert the outer card container to a single, disabled-state-aware `<button>` element, and render the inner label, badge, and illustration image as nested `div` or `span` components. This ensures the entire card remains fully clickable.

### 14. Invisible Social Icons in Clerk Dark Mode
* **Mistake**: Styling Clerk's custom social buttons container background to pure black (`#000000`) in dark mode without adding a visual filter override for provider logos (such as Apple).
* **Problem**: The Apple logo is rendered as a static black SVG inside an `<img>` tag. When the social login button background is pure black, the black logo becomes completely invisible.
* **Fix**: Target the stable Clerk provider icon selector (`.cl-socialButtonsProviderIcon__apple`) and apply `filter: brightness(0) invert(1) !important` in dark mode to invert the black logo to white.

### 15. Overridden Social Button Label Color in Clerk Dark Mode
* **Mistake**: Setting the text color utility class (e.g., `text-clay-ink`) on the outer social button element (`socialButtonsBlockButton`) but failing to target the inner text span (`socialButtonsBlockButtonText`).
* **Problem**: Clerk's default stylesheet applies a dark grey/black color directly to `.cl-socialButtonsBlockButtonText` with high specificity, overriding the inherited text color and making the "Continue with..." text labels invisible in dark mode.
* **Fix**: Apply the `text-clay-ink` class directly to the `socialButtonsBlockButtonText` key inside the Clerk appearance configuration, and add a `.dark .cl-socialButtonsBlockButtonText { color: var(--clay-ink) !important; }` rule in `index.css` to enforce high-contrast visibility.

### 16. Rate Limiter Map Iteration CPU Overhead inside Workers
* **Mistake**: Iterating over a global `Map` of IP entries on every incoming request when the map exceeds a size limit (lazy cleanup).
* **Problem**: Under a large scraping sweep or distributed attack with thousands of unique IPs, the map remains larger than the limit, causing the Worker to iterate through the entire map on every single request. On Cloudflare's free tier, this consumes CPU cycles and triggers the strict 10ms CPU time limit, blocking legitimate users with 500 errors.
* **Fix**: Throttle the cleanup loop to run at most once every 10 seconds, and add a hard limit (e.g. 2000 entries) where the entire map is cleared in O(1) time if it grows too large. This protects Worker isolates from memory leaks and CPU timeouts.
